  about: 'My journey started with a love for problem-solving and a curiosity about how technology shapes everyday life. Over the years, I’ve grown from writing my first lines of C# to architecting enterprise-grade applications with .NET Core, Angular, and cloud-native tools. I thrive in collaborative environments, where Agile practices and DevOps pipelines turn ideas into reality.Beyond code, I’m driven by continuous learning — whether it’s experimenting with Kubernetes, exploring new frameworks, or earning certifications that sharpen my edge. I believe great software is more than functionality; it’s about creating experiences that empower people.'
